Enthusiast on technologies and web, I am graduated master studies in Computer Science from Politecnico di Milano and Politecnico di Torino.

### Why this?

I'm looking forward to save in one place all the small things that solve my problems. I mean, there is a huge collection of answers and tricks online that I"m constantly reaching. Having a pool where to save them and strip them of all the useless fancy contour is the main goal of this blog.
Enjoy it while it last!
